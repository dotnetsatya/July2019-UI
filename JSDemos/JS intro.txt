HTML & CSS 

HTML for presenting content 

CSS for style the page
	

How to work with the page(UI) behaviour?
	e.g.
		Read the form (UI elements)
		Validate form fields
		render the page content dynamically.
		navigate between pages
		store some data for local storage
		..
		..

For this, we can make use of client side scripting for web pages.
e.g.
	JavaScript 

	JavaScript libraries:
			jQuery
			lodash
			React
			
	JavaScript frameworks:
			Angular 
			Vue
			
	Object oriented scripting for JavaScript
			Typescript

Javacript:


Where to include JavaScript in the the HTML page? 


* Head
* Body 


* Head section
	<head>
		<script>
		</script>
		<script src="filename.js"></script>
	</head>

	This get's loaded before actual page content rendered.


* At the end of Body section
	<body>
		<!--conent goes here --> 



		<!--end of body content -->
		<script>
		</script>
	</body>

Here,  the javascript is loaded after page renders.
We would use this always



Note:
Javascript is a case sensitive.

JavaScript uses  camelCasing for methods.

e.g.
	getName()
	setName()

To declare variables:
	Use "var", "const", "let"


var for declaring variables:

var name = "satya";
const name = "satya";
let name = "satya";


what is the difference between "var" and "const" declaration?

	const is for declaring read only variables.


What is scope? 
	The accessibility and lifetime of a variable.


Note:
	"let" is for declaring block level scope.

In Javascript, we use below statements for block level scope
	if(){
	}


	for(){
	}


	switch(){
	}

	while(){	
	}



global
	outside of any thing

function 

	inside of function
block 

	inside of block

e.g.
	for(let i = 0 ;i < 100; i++)
	{
		//i is only applicable here
	}

	

Note:
form elements vs document elements 

for document elements:
	innerText
	innerHTML

e.g.
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
		innerText
	<h1><span>Hello world</span></h1>
		innerHTML

for form elements:
	value
	textbox
	radio
	checkout
